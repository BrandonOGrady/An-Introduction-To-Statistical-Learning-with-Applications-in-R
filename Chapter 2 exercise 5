* What are the advantages and disadvantages of a very flexible (versus a less flexible) approach for regression or classification? *

Some advantages of a very flexible approach are that it could give a better fit for a non-linear model and the bias decreases. Some disadvantages are that it could cause the model
to be overfit that increases the error of the model

*Under what circumstances might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less flexible approach?* 

A more flexible approach may be preferred to a less flexible approach when the model is more interested in prediction than the inference of the results.

*When might a less flexible approach be preferred?*

A less flexible approach may be preferred to a more flexible approach when the model is more interested in the inference than the prediction of the results.
