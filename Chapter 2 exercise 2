a. The study is a regression problem, and we are most interested in inference because the data is quantitative in the form of knowing what affects the CEO salary. 
The sample size is n=500 and the number of predictors is p=3.

b. The study is a classification, and we are most interested in the prediction because we are interested in whether the new product will
be a success or not by observing the data on previously launched products. The sample size is n= 20 and the number of predictors is p=13.

c. The study is a regression problem, and we are most interested in the prediction because we are interested in the percent change in the US/Euro exchange rate in relation 
to the weekly changes in the world stock markets. The data is collected weekly for all of 2012 for the percent change in the US market, British market, and the percent change 
in the German market. The sample size is n=52 (weeks in a year), and the number of predictors is p=3.
