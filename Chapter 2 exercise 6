A parametric approach reduces the problem of estimating f down to one of
estimating a set of parameters because it assumes a form for f.

A non-parametric approach does not assume a functional form for f and so
requires a very large number of observations to accurately estimate f.

The advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification are the
simplifying of modeling f to a few parameters and not as many observations are
required compared to a non-parametric approach.

The disadvantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification
are a potential to inaccurately estimate f if the form of f assumed is wrong or
to overfit the observations if more flexible models are used.
