(a) Better - a more flexible approach will fit the data closer and with the
large sample size a better fit than an inflexible approach would be obtained

(b) Worse - a flexible method would overfit the small number of observations

(c) Better - with more degrees of freedom, a flexible model would obtain a
better fit

(d) Worse - flexible methods fit to the noise in the error terms and increase variance
